The core problem of the screen staying on **"Starting camera..."** is a problem in the camera initialization logic within your custom hook, **`useCamera`**, since your current component code is correct for displaying the status.

Here are the issues and the fix for your `CameraScreen.tsx` component, plus the critical advice for your **`useCamera` hook**.

### 1\. 🛑 Immediate Component Fix (Prevent Switch Flickering)

You must remove the redundant `useEffect` that manually stops and starts the camera when `facingMode` changes. This only causes issues if the camera is already running.

**Remove this block from your `CameraScreen.tsx`:**

```typescript
// ❌ REMOVE THIS BLOCK
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isStreaming) { 
      stopCamera();
      startCamera();
    }
  }, [facingMode]); 
```

### 2\. 🛠️ Critical Fix: The `useCamera` Hook

The "Starting camera..." state means your `startCamera` function is not resolving properly. This is almost always due to one of three things. **You must verify the code inside your `useCamera` hook.**

| Issue | What to Check in `useCamera` | How to Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Silent Error/Hang** | The `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` call is failing or hanging but not setting the `error` state. | **Add `try...catch` and set `error` state.** The `catch` block must set your state: `setError(e.name || 'Unknown camera error');` |
| **Permission Blocked** | The browser pop-up to ask for permission was blocked or hasn't appeared. The promise hangs indefinitely. | **Check your browser console** for a `NotAllowedError`. You need to handle this by displaying the error on the screen. |
| **Missing Ref** | The `videoRef.current` is not available when `startCamera` is called, so the stream starts but cannot be attached to the `<video>` element. | Ensure the video element is rendered or use an `onLoadedMetadata` event on the video tag to check stream readiness, though setting `isStreaming` to `true` should usually be enough. |

#### Conceptual `useCamera` Hook Logic

Ensure your `startCamera` function (in `use-camera.ts`) looks like this:

```typescript
// Inside use-camera.ts (Conceptual)

const startCamera = async (newFacingMode = initialMode) => {
    // 1. Reset state
    setIsStreaming(false);
    setError(null);
    
    // 2. Define constraints
    const constraints = {
        video: { facingMode: newFacingMode, aspectRatio: { ideal: 0.75 } }
    };
    
    try {
        // 3. Get the stream (This is where it hangs if permission is denied or device busy)
        const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints); 

        // 4. Set the video source
        if (videoRef.current) {
            videoRef.current.srcObject = stream;
            // Add an event listener to check when the video is actually playing
            videoRef.current.onloadedmetadata = () => {
                // 5. Update state only when ready
                setIsStreaming(true); 
            };
        }
        
        // Save the stream globally to stop it later
        setMediaStream(stream); 

    } catch (e) {
        // 🚨 CRITICAL: This is how you escape the "Starting..." state on failure
        console.error("Camera failed to start:", e);
        // Display the user-friendly error message
        setError(e.message || 'Camera access denied or device is busy.'); 
    }
};
```

**Next Step:** Please check your browser's **Developer Console** for any errors or warnings (especially those starting with `NotAllowedError` or `OverconstrainedError`) when the screen is stuck on "Starting camera...". This message will tell us exactly why `getUserMedia` is failing.
